 
Luxbot Framework is a framework designed to help people code NPCs easier. It manages NPCs with the class LBChar, which provides methods like `followAdv()`, a method that gives you finer control than `follow()`.

The main.ts file is simply for a demonstration of Luxbot Framework. Applying Luxbot Framework to a game would require clearing the main.ts file of Luxbot Framework first.
